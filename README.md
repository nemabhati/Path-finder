# Path-Finder
The Path Finder finds the shortest path between two points while avoiding obstacles on the way and to present it with a web interface.The Algorithm has been written in JavaScript and the web interface has been developed using HTML5,CSS, Node JS and Javascript.It runs on Node.js and is capable of supporting all the browsers.

PATH FINDING ALGORITHM
At its core, a pathfinding algorithm seeks to find the shortest path between two points.This application visualises various pathfinding algorithms in action. Here, We are using all the algorithms for a 2D grid. Currently, we are using 5 path finding Algorithms.

1.A* -AStar

2.Dijkstra

3.Greedy Best-First Search

4.Breadth-First Search (BFS)

5.Depth-First Search(DFS)
